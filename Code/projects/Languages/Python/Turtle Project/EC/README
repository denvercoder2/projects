Professor AJ, 
I've thoroughly enjoyed this semester, and the material in it.
Thanks for making it relatable, and accessable easily through canvas.
I really appreciate your approach to teaching this class. 

Now that the final time is almost here, I figured now is a good time to send
this project file.

It has 7 different projects.
Some of them being very simple since I was juiist learning the turtle framework
and some are more complex once I started to experiment more with it.

I wish I had time to do more because it's a really interesting framework for graphics,
and has a wide variety of uses.

Thank you for the opertunity to earn some extra credit through a fun and informative
activity like this.
