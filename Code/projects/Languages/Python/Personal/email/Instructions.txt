--- INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN AUTO EMAIL ---


------ Important Note --------
It is recommended (by me), to leave this project on your desktop.
The program will work wherever you have it directory wise, but you have to jump
through more hoops in order for it to work if you don't leave it on the desktop.
If for some reason it ever gets moved or deleted, I can easily fix that, but just as
a warning, leave the folder on your desktop.
------ Important Note --------


--- Steps ---

Step 1) 
Hit the windows key, and type in cmd
After that, type in "cd Desktop\project\email\"
This will take you to the projects main directory.

Step 2)
There will be 3 files in this directory.
They should be named "auto_email.py", "auto_email_gui.py", and "residents.csv"
You'll want to type this command into your terminal screen (The screen you got to in step one): python auto_email_gui.py
This will make a popup window.

Step 3)
When the popup window comes up, click the button in the window.
This will allow you to type a message into the terminal screen to send to all residents
who are on the mailing list.

Step 4)
When you are finished with the text, hit enter. The program will then take that message,
format it, and send it to all residents on email list.
After the program is finished, the program will exit.
That's all.
