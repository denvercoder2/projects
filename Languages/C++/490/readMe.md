# Implementation and Notes on Round Robin Program
## General Idea
- Given our input, I'm reading that input into a vector to use in functions in order to accurately depict this implementation

- Documentation on the functions is located within the file in the form of comment headers. This is followed by individual comments on the more complex parts in the code

---
## Running the code
 - This program was written and tested on Ubuntu 16.04, using the g++ compiler, c++ version 11.
  
- Below in the bash visual, I'm demonstrating the way to compile and run:
  
  ```
  # run the following code to compile this program
  g++ Round_Robbin.cpp -o main -std=c++11 

  # Now run the code with following command
  ./main
  ```
