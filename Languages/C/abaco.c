    At line 3, we are adding the use of the
    stdlib, which in itself is just a text file 
    that can be processed. 

    At line 10, the "printf" function is
    a variable argument function. Meaning it can take a
    variable amount of parameters. This function is available 
    from reading and essentially "dumping" the text from the library
    into this file.
