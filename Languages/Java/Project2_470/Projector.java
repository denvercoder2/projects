======================================== GENERAL OVERVIEW ========================================
| The Projector Class is to act as an interface for the mobile device to find                    |
| The projector should have two modes (Classroom, or dorm).                                      |
| This is to be specified to the mobile device, and from there, the type of media                |
| that can be displayed is determined.                                                           |
| There is also a choice on what type of cast to use                                             |
