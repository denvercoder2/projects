## Instructions On Running

`If you have an instance of python running on your machine :` 
-  I've written a build tool using python in order to compile the code in the correct order. It's mainly to save myself time in the testing phase, but if you want to run it for grading, I'll put the instructions in a terminal below. This wasn't part of the assignment, so I used something not approved for the languages.

```bash
    # running the build tool
    python3.7 buildTool.py  # Use your instance of python to call the script 
```

`If you just want to compile it normally : `
```bash
#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linux and Windows instructions

javac MobileDevice.java    # Compile the class to translate into bytecode
javac Projector.java       # Compile the class to translate into bytecode

java MobileDevice          # Start search on Mobile Device 
java Projector             # Start pair on Projector
#------------------------------------------------------------------
```
`If you just set it up as a project : `
- Disregard this readMe, and do whatever you usually do for running.
