CS 470/570 Project 1  Socket Programming

Suppose that you are designing a smart appliance and you want to make sure the appliance will have the latest version of the software. So, when a user turns on the appliance for the first time, it will connect to your server on the Internet to check whether it has the latest version of the software.

 

Build the following client and server programs. 

 

The client (appliance) connects to your server when you start the program.
The server waits on a fixed IP address and a port number. (You may hard code the numbers in your program.)
The client sends its current version of the software.
The server displays the message from the client and also displays the client’s IP address on its screen. The client’s IP address should not be hard coded in its message.
The server returns a newer version of the software.
The client displays a message which asks user to confirm the upgrade of the software.
 

You may program in C, C++, C#, or Java.

Your program will run in the CS department PC lab.

 

Prepare to show a demo.

 

You are to deliver

1.A (commented) code listing (hard copy).

2.Source and binary via Canvas.

3.The screen shots of your test cases (hard copy). Make sure that you test edge cases.

 

If you use code from elsewhere, you should give credit in the comments.

Your code should be thoroughly commented.

Your score on this assignment will include consideration of the correctness of your code, readability of the code, and quality of internal documentation (commenting).
